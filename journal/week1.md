# Week 1 — App Containerization

```markdown

# Cloud Project Class Weekly Summary

This week's cloud project class focused on launching, installing, and verifying various components of our project. Here's a breakdown of what we covered:

## Launching

- Created a new GitHub repo for our project and launched it within a new Gitpod workspace.
- Configured the Gitpod.yml configuration to include VSCode extensions that we would need for our project.
- Cloned the frontend and backend repos and updated the frontend React with the Notifications page that shows the User’s Feed.

## Installing

- Installed and tested a local instance of DynamoDB and Postgres.
- Researched and learned Docker.
- Created a Dockerfile for the app and ensured that we could get the app running via individual containers.
- Created a docker-compose file to orchestrate multiple containers to run side by side.

## Verifying

- Explored the codebases of DynamoDB and Postgres to ensure that we could get the apps running locally.
- Gained practical knowledge working with common Docker command and running container images for the purpose of local development.
- Gained practical knowledge of working within a Cloud Development environment.
- Troubleshooted repository vulnerabilities using SNYK.
- Researched best practices of Dockerfiles and attempted to implement them in the Dockerfile that we wrote.
- Studied AWS ECS and the Well Architected Framework to understand best practices for cloud application development.

# Ways to Gain Practical Knowledge in Docker and Cloud Development

## Gain Practical Knowledge Working with Docker

1. **Docker documentation:** The Docker documentation is a great place to start. It provides a comprehensive guide on Docker commands and usage.

2. **Docker tutorials:** There are several online tutorials that provide step-by-step guidance on how to use Docker for local development. These tutorials often include sample applications that can be used to experiment with Docker.

3. **Docker images:** Experiment with different Docker images that are available on Docker Hub. This will give you a better understanding of how images are built and how they can be used to run applications.

4. **Docker Compose:** Learn how to use Docker Compose to orchestrate multiple containers. This will help you understand how to run multi-container applications.

## Gain Practical Knowledge of Working Within a Cloud Development Environment

1. **Cloud documentation:** Each cloud provider has extensive documentation on their services. Familiarize yourself with the services that the provider offers and how they work.

2. **Cloud tutorials:** Cloud providers often provide tutorials and sample applications that can be used to get started with their services. These tutorials can help you understand how to deploy applications to the cloud and how to use different cloud services.

3. **Cloud certification:** Consider getting certified in a specific cloud platform such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud. Certification requires a deep understanding of the cloud platform and can help you gain practical knowledge of cloud development.

4. **Participate in online communities:** Join online communities such as Stack Overflow, Reddit, and GitHub to ask questions and get feedback from others working in cloud development. This will help you gain practical knowledge from others who have more experience in cloud development.

Overall, it was a productive week where we gained practical skills and knowledge of launching, installing, and verifying various components of our cloud project. We are excited to continue learning and building on these skills as we move forward with our project.
