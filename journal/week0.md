# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture


On our first day, we gathered as a full class, with detailed guidance and kind words of introduction to our instructors, who all possessed immense enthusiasm for the cloud and the various strengths they each brought to the table. This two-hour session provided a gentle start to what promised to be a rigorous, multi-disciplinary journey into the world of AWS cloud computing and full stack development. During this time, we were briefed on the bootcamp's expectations and objectives, as well as being given a wealth of information, from best practices to resources. We were also given a chance to voice our individual goals and aspirations for the program.

The instructors shared their expertise and experience in the field, which was incredibly valuable to all of us in the class. We were also able to gain insight into the various approaches to cloud computing and the nuances of the AWS platform. This gave us a solid foundation to build upon, as we began our journey into the world of cloud computing.

This upcoming project promises to be even more demanding, yet also far more rewarding. I am looking forward to the opportunity to acquire a wide range of new skills, as well as to gain a deeper comprehension of cloud computing. This bootcamp has already provided me with an invaluable experience and I am eager to discover the full range of possibilities that this domain has to offer. I am confident that I will gain even more from this bootcamp and I am thrilled to see what lies ahead in the coming weeks. I am excited to develop my understanding of the cloud, and to explore the opportunities that it offers. I am sure that I will gain an even greater appreciation of the power and potential of the cloud, as I continue my journey into this remarkable field.

During this first week, I've been able to take a closer look at various AWS services, such as EC2 instances, S3 storage, and VPCs, among others. I've learned how to securely launch EC2 instances, create S3 buckets, and secure my IAM, all while gaining a deeper understanding of the AWS infrastructure and the many benefits it offers. I have also added credits to my account, learned some billing tactics, including alerts and budgets.
Also :

- got some practice on cloudshell,  cli within gitpod, and get a refresher on the C4 model software visualization.
- learn about security, organizations, and  generating AWS credentials as an essential part of working with the AWS platform.
- created an AWS Zero spend budget , alarm, and new user.
- completed the todo checklist above
- created a related post on LinkedIn.
